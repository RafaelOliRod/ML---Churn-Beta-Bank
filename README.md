# Churn Detection in Banking Customers

This repository contains a detailed study on churn detection (customer attrition) using banking data. The main objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting which customers are likely to leave the bank, allowing the institution to take proactive measures to retain these customers.

## Repository Contents

1. **Dataset**:
   - **Description**: The dataset includes demographic, financial, and behavioral information of bank customers.
   - **Preprocessing**: Steps for data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations and descriptive statistics to better understand the data distribution and identify relevant patterns for churn.

3. **Machine Learning Modeling**:
   - **Models Used**: Implementation and comparison of various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - **Evaluation**: Performance metrics of the models, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

4. **Results and Conclusions**:
   - Discussion of the obtained results, interpretation of the main factors contributing to churn, and suggestions for strategies to mitigate customer loss.

5. **Code**:
   - Python scripts organized in Jupyter notebooks to facilitate the reproduction and understanding of the study. Each step, from exploratory analysis to modeling, is well-documented and commented.

6. **Documentation and Final Report**:
   - A detailed final report covering all the steps of the study, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis and a robust predictive model for churn detection in banking customers, which can be used as a basis for customer retention strategies. This repository serves as an educational resource for students and professionals interested in data science applied to the banking sector.
